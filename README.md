# Semantic Copycat BinarySniffer: Static Binary Analysis for SBOM

A practical tool for static analysis of binaries and their software bill of materials (SBOM). It helps teams spot code copycat patterns, detect potential license and legal issues, and improve software provenance in open source and proprietary binaries. This project focuses on clarity, portability, and reproducible results. It blends binary analysis with legaltech needs to support open source compliance and risk management.

What this project is for
- Purpose: Provide a lightweight, fast, and reliable way to inspect binaries for structural patterns, copied code footprints, and linkage information that matters for SBOM accuracy and license compliance.
- Audience: Security teams, software supply chain engineers, policy teams, and developers who care about legal tech and open source governance.
- Outcome: A clear report that helps teams decide on remediations, updates, or proper licensing disclosures.

Quick start
- Prerequisites:
  - A modern Python environment (Python 3.8+ recommended).
  - Access to the Releases page to fetch the appropriate binary or script for your platform.
- Getting started:
  - Download the asset from the Releases page and run the binary or install the Python package according to the platform instructions.
  - Point the tool at the target binary or extract a set of binaries from a distribution package.
  - Review the generated report, which highlights copied code patterns, licensing signals, and SBOM details.
- Where to learn more:
  - The Releases page contains the latest builds and related assets. You can visit it again to check for updates, changelogs, and platform-specific notes.

How it works
- Core idea: The tool analyzes binary artifacts without requiring source code. It looks for:
  - Code similarity footprints that may indicate copycat behavior.
  - Imported symbols and library traces that relate to licensing and provenance.
  - Structural patterns in binaries that align with known code layouts and SBOM signals.
- Output: A structured report including a summary, detail sections per binary, and a map of potential compliance issues.

Supported platforms
- Linux, macOS, and Windows are supported through platform-specific binaries or Python-based execution.
- The goal is consistent behavior across environments so teams can rely on the same output format regardless of OS.
- If you encounter platform-specific differences, contribute a fix or clarification so the project can improve coverage.

Core features
- Binary copycat detection: Finds similarities between binary sections that may indicate copied code or reused binaries without proper attribution.
- SBOM-oriented reporting: Extracts SBOM-related data such as component names, version hints, and license indicators.
- Legaltech signals: Flags potential licensing conflicts, ambiguous attributions, and missing disclosures.
- Fast, local analysis: Runs on your machine without heavy server dependencies, preserving privacy and reducing exposure to external services.
- Extensible output: Produces machine-readable results suited for integration into your CI, governance dashboards, or ticketing systems.
- Reproducible runs: Uses deterministic analysis paths to enable reliable comparisons across runs and environments.

Architecture and design
- Modular structure: The tool is broken into core analysis, data extraction, reporting, and integration layers. Each part can be extended or replaced without breaking the rest.
- Stateless analysis: Analyses run without needing to modify the source binary or rely on external stateful services.
- Configurable pipeline: Users can customize the steps, skip sections, or adjust heuristics to fit their risk tolerance and regulatory requirements.
- Clear interfaces: Public APIs expose results in a predictable format, making it easy to wire into other tools.

Data flow and outputs
- Input: Target binary files or bundles.
- Processing steps:
  - Disassembly or pattern extraction to reveal code structures.
  - Signature matching to identify known code blocks or library footprints.
  - License and attribution heuristics to surface potential gaps.
  - SBOM mapping to align findings with SBOM standard concepts.
- Output artifacts:
  - A human-readable report with sections for overview, findings, and recommended actions.
  - A machine-readable JSON payload suitable for automation.
  - Optional visualizations (maps of components, relationships, and risk signals).

Extensibility and plugins
- Plugin model: Extend the tool with custom detectors, additional license checks, or integration hooks.
- Plugin lifecycle: Discover plugins at startup, load them, and run them as part of the analysis pipeline.
- Community contributions: The plugin system invites collaborators to add detectors for niche ecosystems or private code patterns.
- Example plugin ideas:
  - A detector for obfuscated sections that may hide copied code.
  - An integration plugin that exports results to a ticketing system (Jira, GitHub Issues).
  - A license hint plugin that focuses on rare or new licensing terms.

SBOM integration and legal compliance
- SBOM alignment: The tool maps findings to SBOM concepts like components, licenses, relationships, and provenance.
- License awareness: It highlights licenses commonly encountered in binaries and flags potential mismatches or missing attributions.
- Legal risk signals: The output includes risk tags and recommended actions to support decision-making with legal and compliance teams.
- Open-source governance: The tool supports organizations aiming to strengthen open source program offices (OSPOs) and compliance workflows.

Use cases and scenarios
- Software supply chain security: Detect potential code reuse or copied components in delivered binaries.
- Open source compliance: Verify license disclosures and attribution accuracy in binary artifacts.
- Legal tech workflows: Provide evidence and structured data to support legal review and policy enforcement.
- Compliance automation: Feed results into CI pipelines to enforce governance checks automatically.
- Software modernization: Understand legacy binaries and map them to SBOM elements for modernization plans.
